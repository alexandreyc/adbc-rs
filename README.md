# Arrow Database Connectivity for Rust

This is a Rust implementation of [Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC)](https://arrow.apache.org).

It's still work in progress and should not be used in production.

## TODOs

- Add enum for statistics
- Document multi threading semantics
- Add examples (and doc example)
